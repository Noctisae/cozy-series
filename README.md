Cozy Series is a simple script to add all your series in your Cozy Calendar. Just type a command line and watch your Cozy Calendar be filled with events for each episode of your series. You can now be informed when a new episode come out ! Each series is updated daily, to make sure you don't miss a single thing of your favorites series.
